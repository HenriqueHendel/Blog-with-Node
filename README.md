# Node Blog

## About this Project
It is a simple blog, where the Admin (can be more than one person or only the owner/author of blog) can write, update and delete posts of all categories. The users can access the blog and read the posts

This project is a part of my personal portfilio and my objective is ever improve my code skills and knowledge. So, if you could provide me any feedback, I will be very happy :)

## Some Observations 

1 - I have display in the navbar manu an option to "Login", but it's only for the example. In the production mode, only the Admin of the blog will can access the login page

2 - There are only programming categories, but you can create any kind of categorie

## How It Works

- To write a post, you have to be the admin and choice some categorie (C#, PHP, BackEnd, etc), beyond the Title, Content and Slug. If don't have the categorie that you want, you can create at the page "My Categories"

- "Slug" is the text that will appear at the URL of you post, for example "http://MyBlog/postagem/como-ser-um-bom-backend", where "como-ser-um-bom-backend" is the slug

- In the page "My posts", you can write, update or delete a post
